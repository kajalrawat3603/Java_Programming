multi threading in java is a process of executing multi threads simultaneously(when one task waits it jump to other task 
and ideal time will be reduced).
so,independent work can be executed simultaneously.
Multi threading in java is a process of executing two or more threads simultaneously to maximum utilization of CPU.
thread are managed by jvm(jvm provide info. to CPU)
example :	kitchen,water,chef
	*waiter will be in ideal situation.
	*main thread(if no other thread is there, then work will be done by one main thread)
	
two ways to create a thread in java:
	1-by implementing runnable interface.
		Have to provide override definition of run method 
	2-by extending thread class
		have to provide override definition of run method
	
T1,T2|	 
there are variuos stages 


start() and run()
	*when we call start method, then separate call stack will be created for that particular thread
	*when we call run method directly, then it will be stored in current stack [ usually in main method stack]
	*we should not call run method directly, let the jvm execute run()method through start() method by 
	creating seperate call stack.
	*otherwise it will behave as a simple current thread method
